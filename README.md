## Installation üìÑ

In order to set up your own instance of Kanboard, you must first install Docker, setup Appwrite, create necessary data collections, clone KanBoard repo and configure environmental variables.

We will go through each step in more details below:

1Ô∏è‚É£ To install [Docker](https://docker.com) check the official installation guidelines [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Next you have to install the [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io) using the commands below, depending of the operating system you use:

- Mac / Linux or Unix compatible:

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
    --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    --volume "$(pwd)"/appwrite:/usr/src/code/appwrite:rw \
    --entrypoint="install" \
    appwrite/appwrite:latest
```

- Windows (command prompt)

```bash
docker run -it --rm ^
    --volume //var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ^
    --volume "%cd%"/appwrite:/usr/src/code/appwrite:rw ^
    --entrypoint="install" ^
    appwrite/appwrite:latest
```

- Windows (powershell)

```bash
docker run -it --rm ,
    --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ,
    --volume ${pwd}/appwrite:/usr/src/code/appwrite:rw ,
    --entrypoint="install" ,
    appwrite/appwrite:latest
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ Next open Docker and run the Appwrite app. At this point you should be able to access the Appwrite console through [localhost](http://localhost). Create an account, log in and create new project.

4Ô∏è‚É£ To init your SDK and interact with Appwrite services, you need to add a Web platform to your project. To do that choose the project you created and click the 'Add Platform' button.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Create four database collections: Posts, Columns, Boards and Activities.

Now set the attributes and indexes for each collection as below:

**Posts attributes and indexes**

**Columns attributes and indexes**

**Boards attribute**

**Activities attributes**

6Ô∏è‚É£ Set read and write permissions. Go into the settings for each collection and set the permission to `role:member` for both read and write access.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Navigate to the users panel and add a new user you will use to log in you app and access KanBoard. At this point we are done with the Apprite configuration.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repo to your machine by running `git clone https://github.com/madzadev/kanboard.git` then change the working directory into it by `cd kanboard` and install the project packages by `npm install`.

9Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the env files with the command `cp .env.example .env.local`. In the newly created `.env.local` file fill out the keys from your Appwrite console. First two required are available in the Settings of KanBan project. The other four can be found in the Settings of each Collection.

1Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ Run the command `npm run dev` to start the app.
First setup Docker
